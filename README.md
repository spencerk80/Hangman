# Hangman
The program will guess a word from a hardcoded list of words. You must try to guess the word by entering a letter at a time. If you can get it under 6 guesses, you win. If not, then you're hanged and lose the game.

### Update
The game will now keep track of high scores. Gallows art is now loaded from a file.
